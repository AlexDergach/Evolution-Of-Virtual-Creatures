The project commences with the camera positioned at the character's head. You can observe and navigate using [W], [A], [S], [D], with the additional functions of [Shift] for sprinting and [Space] for jumping.

At the start of the game, the creature will move towards a food source. The simulation incorporates a built-in day and night cycle, allowing you to preview the creature's different textures as time progresses.

You can press the 'Esc' key at any point to exit the program.
